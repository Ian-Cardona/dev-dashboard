# Dev Dashboard Extension

Sync your workspace TODOs to the Dev Dashboard. This extension scans your VS Code projects for `// TODO:` comments and keeps them organized in one centralized place.

- **Automatic Scanning:** Finds all `// TODO:` comments in your workspace
- **One-Click Sync:** Push TODOs to the dashboard instantly
- **Stay Organized:** Keep track of all development tasks without leaving VS Code

## Getting Started

1. Get your API key from the Dev Dashboard web app
2. Open VS Code settings and add your API key to the extension
3. TODOs are scanned automatically from your open workspace
4. Sync whenever you want to update the dashboard
